# MsNB-MCNP-AutoDeck
This is a PYTHON script that automatically generates the MCNP input deck that models the MsNB that I am studying for my M.S. Thesis. You may copy, edit, etc. for your own purposes without requesting permission.  This script is optimized for use in Windows, as it writes .bat files rather than .sh files. If you run a unix based OS, you may wish to edit the master file to write .sh files instead,
